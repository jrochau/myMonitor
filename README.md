# myMonitor
Systems Tool - This is just to demonstrate Java programing capabilities. This is to mimic a task manager. 

Updated app to represent data better visually. Process monitory section added with PID and memory usage. 

Alert added for when memory reaches 80% threshold

Want to integrate a separate program in C to better handle the PID and CPU usage
